## About Me

I am a back-end developer specialising in Go, Node.js/Express, APIs, and web services development.

Databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL feature heavily in my toolset. As do back-end technologies like Docker and Supabase. I use server-side rendering (Go templates and EJS) for my front-end needs. For testing, I rely on Go's built-in testing package, Jest, and Playwright.

I am currently deep-diving into Go internals, concurrency, benchmarking, profiling, and production-grade engineering practices.

My current interests include microservice architecture and systems design.
