## About Me

With 23 years of experience in the software industry, I have worn many hats – but right now, I am loving my journey into full-stack web development.

My love for software development and business systems is fueled by a passion for solving complex problems, embracing new technologies, and rekindling my love for computer programming. I am dedicated to cultivating collaboration and empowering others through meaningful support. I firmly believe that "you win as a team and you lose as a team!"

I am also a huge fan of all things Crypto, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse, Blockchain, and Web3.

## Interesting Facts

🎫 I have been to hundreds of live music concerts in my life... Everything from Foo Fighters to Andrea Bocelli.  
🕺 I'm just as bad at kung-fu as I am at New Year’s Eve dance-offs – and I have the scars to prove it!  
🎤 I once mic'ed up Professor Brian Cox before his guest talk on visiting the then newly-built Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.  
🐴 My first job in the UK was as a stud hand, where I regularly groomed a 1.15 million dollar stallion named Ishiguru. Nowadays, I just groom our sausage dog.  
🎸 I once served an espresso to the famous guitarist Joe Satriani.  
💾 Many moons ago, I achieved a top 100 ranking in a prestigious national computer Olympiad during my final year of high school in South Africa. I competed using the Turbo Pascal programming language.
